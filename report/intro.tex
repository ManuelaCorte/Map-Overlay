\section{Introduction}
The project aims at implementing a sweep line algorithm for computing the overlay of two planar subdivisions. To achieve this goal, the project is divided into three main parts: the implementation of the sweep line algorithm for computing the intersection of line segments, the implementation of the doubly connected edge list data structure, and the implementation of the overlay algorithm.

The project is implemented in Python and the code, along with some examples, is available on GitHub at the following link: \url{https://github.com/ManuelaCorte/Map-Overlay.git}. The project can be run from a simple command line interface that allows the user to either execute exclusively the sweep line algorithm for line segment intersection or the overlay algorithm.
